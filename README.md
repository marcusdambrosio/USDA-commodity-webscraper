# USDA Commodity Pricing Data Pipeline

This is a data pipeline that pulls real crop/commodity pricing data from the USDA website based off of actual trade values in North America.

It is currently configured to pull 10 crops but can be expanded to any amount of crops or reduced to only one point of focus. The final result of this data is a collection of specifically formatted data for each crop initially queried for. This was originally used to fuel a real-time crop pricing index on an agriculture web platform of mine that is now inactive.
